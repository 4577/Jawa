# Jawa

Jawa's full documentation is available both in source (as docstrings) and
online [here](http://jawa.tkte.ch). Contributions to the
documentation (and especially examples) are greatly appreciated.

# History

Jawa is the successor project to Solum, a very quick and hacky JVM library
written to hack on a few [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net) automated RE tools.
